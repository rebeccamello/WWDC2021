 # Introduction
 
 Hey there! I'm Becca, how are you?
 
 Wait... I think I don't see you... Can you press this little button called "Run my Code", so we can talk better?

/*:
 There you are!!

 It's such a beautiful night, isn't it? I love standing here and looking at the stars. Did you know that each one of them are, in fact, giant spheres composed of various gases? And, although they look close to each other, they are kilometers away.

 How about we go for a walk in the field and observe the stars in the [next page](@next)? It's something I really like to do and I would love it if you'd come with me.
