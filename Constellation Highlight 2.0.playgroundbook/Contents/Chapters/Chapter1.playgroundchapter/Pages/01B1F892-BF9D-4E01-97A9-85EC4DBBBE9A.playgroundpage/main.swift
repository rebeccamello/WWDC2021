 # Drawing a constellation
 
....Wait... See that, too? It seems that there are some stars that, if we connect them, could form a cross... Can you see? Oh, how cool!! Let's do this together?

 Connect the 4 largest points of the screen in a cross shape. If you need some inspiration, you can look at the model below. And don't worry, if you make any mistakes and want to draw again, there is a little button next to the model, called "Reset", that will help you start over again.

 Alright, let's do this!

 Well done! You drew the constellation called **Cruzeiro do Sul**. Let's understand better what that is in the [next page](@next)?
