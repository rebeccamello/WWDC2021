 # What is a constellation?
 
 Each constellation is a set of stars that can represent various things, like objects and animals. They appear according to Earth's movement around the Sun, so we see different constellations depending on where we are on the planet! Another cool thing is that they had great importance in the history of some people and were used as a way of determining location in the past.
 
 Do you think we can find some more around here? Maybe we can find out in the [next page](@next).
